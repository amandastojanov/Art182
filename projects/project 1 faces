## Exercise 1: Four Examples
Bring in 4 pieces / videos / links
A work you like and think is good.
A work you don’t like and think is bad.
A work you like, but think might not be good.
A work you don’t like, but think might actually be good.

Be prepared to explain your choices to the class.

These don’t have to be artworks related to code / technology / the internet / software in some way and possibly are examples of something you would like (or not like) to get out of the class.


# Project 1 : Two Faced
Part A

Design an abstract or simplified face composed of 10-20 basic shapes (rectangles, ellipses, lines, triangles, polygons, stars). Look at the links and images below as a reference. Create two emotions for this face, one neutral, and one exaggerated. For instance, a very sad frown, and a neutral expression. Have a plan in mind for how the face might transition from neutral to exaggerated. You may only move, rotate, and scale the facial features, it should not "pop" from one expression to the next. Think about all the different faces we’ve looked at and how you can construct a face both human or non-human.

Before you begin coding, sketch this face out either on paper, or in photoshop/illustrator/your software of choice and bring them to class. Also arrive with your neutral face translated into p5 code. Make sure your sketch size is set at 500px x 500px
