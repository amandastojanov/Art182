## Exercise 1: Four Examples
Bring in 4 pieces / videos / links
A work you like and think is good.
A work you don’t like and think is bad.
A work you like, but think might not be good.
A work you don’t like, but think might actually be good.

Be prepared to explain your choices to the class.

These don’t have to be artworks related to code / technology / the internet / software in some way and possibly are examples of something you would like (or not like) to get out of the class.


# Project 1 : Two Faced
## Part A
Design an abstract or simplified face composed of 10-20 basic shapes (rectangles, ellipses, lines, triangles, polygons, stars). Look at the links and images below as a reference. Create two emotions for this face, one neutral, and one exaggerated. For instance, a very sad frown, and a neutral expression. Have a plan in mind for how the face might transition from neutral to exaggerated. You may only move, rotate, and scale the facial features, it should not "pop" from one expression to the next. Think about all the different faces we’ve looked at and how you can construct a face both human or non-human.

Before you begin coding, sketch this face out either on paper, or in photoshop/illustrator/your software of choice and bring them to class. Also arrive with your neutral face translated into p5 code. Make sure your sketch size is set at 500px x 500px

Here’s some links and artists for inspiration:
Apophenia
Pareidolia
Love Bytes
Nokia / Friends / Heathrow
Bruno Munari
Early Disney Sketches
Kasemir Malevich
Picasson & other cubist sculptures
Isamu Noguchi
Joge-e & two way pictures
David Hockney
Emojis & Mac Finder Face


## Part B
Add variables to your project from Part A so that the face can move between the neutral and exaggerated expressions by changing the value of the variables. The variables can change the color, position, scale, rotation, etc. of your face. Don't forget to write comments in your code so that you know the range of the variable i.e int x = 100; // left eye x - coordinate with a value between 100 and 200. Be careful when trying out rotation and scale, they can be tricky.


## Part C
Modify your code from part B so that the face changes fluidly from the neutral expression to the strong expression as you move the mouse across the screen. The map function will be your friend for this. You will need to include a setup() and draw() to your project so that variables in the draw() can be updated on the fly. Think about how you can develop in-between expressions and make the face as dynamic and emotive as possible. I have put together an example TK.
